> Try to be less wrong. You are definitely wrong to some degree. The question is how wrong and can you be less wrong tomorrow? (Elon Musk)

***

I'm a physicist by training with a great interest in computer science and specialized in the field of computational physics and machine learning. I'm constantly working my way through the field of physics, computer science and machine learning, so I have picked up a few things. 

I enjoy coding, working with data, trying out new ideas, and solving real world problems. I mostly use Python, C++, and C to get things done and like to automate stuff with Bash. 

I'm working as a machine learning research engineer and I am committed to do my part to make humanity be the best it can be by using technology to maximize the probability that the future is good.

In this blog, I informally share pet projects, ideas, half-baked thoughts and code about topics in machine learning, computational physics and other topics I am interested in. Please don't expect too many footnotes or references or anything scholarly in my blog posts. This is more of a personal page. I just hope I can manage to convey some ideas in a way that is comprehensible and fun.
